# Stats101C_AintNoBiasHighEnough

**Ideas/Concerns**

- Name the training data "Basketball_train" and testing data "Basketball_test" for consistency
- This is a classification problem so our approaches are KNN, Logistic, LDA, QDA
- We have 217 potential predictors and consolidating them given the seeming independence of the basketball scoring statistics, will be a challenge. 
- Since none of us are Basketball fantatics, we can probably find some literature explaining how the variables correlate. 
- Response being categorical makes it hard to draw out correlations. 

**Attempts at avoiding multicollinearity**

- Could run VIF's against a variable that is starkly different from the set. 

## Nish

Attempts made: 
1. Logistic regression with arbitrarily chosen predictors
2. Logistic regression with predictors chosen by Regsubsetts (using a select supplied group of 16 predictors obtained from research)
3. KNN with K=5 on columns 11:30
4. Ridge 
5. Lasso
